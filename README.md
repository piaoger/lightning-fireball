## how to setup

1. pygame

Using a latest version of pygame which works fine on Mac .

Maybe we need to instal smpeg before pygame to avoid "Unrecognized audio format" issue while loding "*.mp3" file

```
brew install smpeg
pip3 install pygame==2.0.0.dev10  -i http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/ --trusted-host mirrors.aliyun.com
```
